Vikingaxe Books offers a diverse selection of books, including paperback, hardcover, and eBooks. The specialty lies in the genre of fiction reality, where these crafted stories could have happened in the past or might unfold in the future based on theoretical possibilities. These books are crafted to engage readers by seamlessly merging reality with fiction, encouraging them to explore the ‘what ifs’ of history and the future.
The collection includes tales of historical events with a twist, exploring alternate outcomes and hidden stories that could have changed the course of history. Imagine a world where the Vikings discovered America long before Columbus, or a future where humanity has colonized Mars and faces unforeseen challenges. These are the kinds of intriguing scenarios you can expect from Vikingaxe Books.

The work involves both the creative aspect of storytelling and the analytical pursuit of understanding the real-world elements that may have inspired these books.  Whether you prefer the tactile experience of a hardcover, the convenience of a paperback, or the accessibility of an eBook, these various forms are offered. From the cover design to the final page, every element has been thoughtfully crafted to draw you into the story.

At Vikingaxe Books, it is believed that great stories have the power to inspire, educate, and entertain. The mission is to provide readers with thought-provoking narratives that challenge their perceptions and ignite their imaginations. Join the journey through time and space, and discover the endless possibilities that fiction reality has to offer.</h4>
